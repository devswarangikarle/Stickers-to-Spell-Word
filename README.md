# Stickers-to-Spell-Word

We are given n different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
You would like to spell out the given string target by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
Return the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
Note: In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.

class Solution:

    def minStickers(self, stickers: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        t_count = collections.Counter(target)
        A = [collections.Counter(sticker) & t_count
             for sticker in stickers]

        for i in range(len(A) - 1, -1, -1):
            if any(A[i] == A[i] & A[j] for j in range(len(A)) if i != j):
                A.pop(i)

        stickers = ["".join(s_count.elements()) for s_count in A]
        dp = [-1] * (1 << len(target))
        dp[0] = 0
        for state in range(1 << len(target)):
            if dp[state] == -1: continue
            for sticker in stickers:
                now = state
                for letter in sticker:
                    for i, c in enumerate(target):
                        if (now >> i) & 1: continue
                        if c == letter:
                            now |= 1 << i
                            break
                if dp[now] == -1 or dp[now] > dp[state] + 1:
                    dp[now] = dp[state] + 1

        return dp[-1]
